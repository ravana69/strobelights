The nature of this website and its rapidly flashing images may also cause seizures in certain individuals.

        <h2>Risk:</h2>
        <p>Reflex epilepsies are a group of epilepsy syndromes in which specific triggers or stimuli bring on seizures. Read more about reflex epilepsy at epilepsy.com. <br><br>

        Photosensitive epilepsy is when seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns. Photosensitive epilepsy is not common but it may be diagnosed when you have an EEG test. <br><br>
        
        Flashing or patterned effects can make people with or without epilepsy feel disorientated, uncomfortable or unwell. The frequency or speed of flashing light that is most likely to cause seizures varies from person to person. Generally, flashing lights most likely to trigger seizures are between the frequency of 5 to 30 flashes per second (Hertz).
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Always avoid flashing or flickering images if it makes you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>If flashing images cannot be avoided it may be beneficial to close one eye with your hand.</li>
            <li>Avoid looking directly at the screen when a flashing light is present.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Treatment:</h2>
        <p>Please seek immediate medical assistance if you feel unwell while using this website.
        The best method to treat epilepsy is to avoid the stimulus that triggers seizures.
