        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever been at a house party where the only element that was still needed to make your own in-house club was a strobe light? Or have you ever tried to set a romantic vibe in your living room on date night with your loved one? These are the exact reasons why we created www.strobelights.co.za! Whether you are a party animal who wants to have a club experience in your living room, or just want to set the mood with some ambient light, you’ve come to the right place! <br><br>

            Cellphones and TV-led screens have become so strong that they can have a very similar effect to an actual strobe light, which makes it possible to have an endless amount of light effects right in your pocket. <br><br>

            Our website was born with the heart of a student in mind, where parties continue until long after the clubs are closed. We wanted to give students, all around the world, the ability to take their club experience to the safety and the comfort of their homes. We’ve designed our website so that it will function perfectly on devices such as smart TV’s and Desktop computers, to ensure that our website can be used on the biggest screens in your living space. <br><br>

            The bigger the screen the bigger the effect! <br><br>

            It was also important for us to make this site as accessible as possible, by making it readily available on the internet for free, so that you can enjoy the full power of our website with the click of a button. We hope you enjoy using our online strobe light and please tell your friends about us or share our website on social media. <br><br>

            Kind regards from the Store Light Inc. Team
